# To-Stack-or-Diversify
SAL 213 Project:

This study analyzes whether stacking or diversification is a better fantasy football draft strategy using 2017-2019 NFL data. Simulated Best Ball teams and OLS models show which stacks are most beneficial in Half and Full PPR.

Numerous strategies are employed when assembling a fantasy football team, such as a heavy emphasis on running backs or securing a top-tier quarterback within the initial rounds of the draft. However, another strategic method frequently employed is player stacking, where individuals select players from the same NFL team, pairing a quarterback with a different player, as exemplified by combinations like Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs or Patrick Mahomes and Isiah Pacheco. The fundamental principle behind stacking is the correlation between the performance of the quarterback and the other player; when the quarterback excels, the other player is more likely to follow suit. However, it is essential to recognize that this approach presents a dual-edged sword, as a quarterback's subpar performance can adversely affect the player’s output.
Given the expansive reach of football as a sport and the ever-increasing popularity of fantasy football, the inquiry into whether it is more advantageous to implement a stacking strategy or diversify one's player selections. This evaluation will be conducted in the context of Half Points-Per-Reception (Half PPR) vs. Full Points-Per-Reception (Full PPR) points, with the ultimate aim of determining the optimal approach to construct the most competitive fantasy football team.
